## Motivation
To put together 8 weeks of material into one final project utilizing an unknown API, RESTful and MVC design concepts, Spring framework and an HTML/CSS based frontend utilzing Thymeleaf. 


## Tools used
[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) Java template engine.  
[Spring + Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) framework.

##Screenshots
Below is the initial screen after inputting a query. You are presented with 5 users and 5 randomized tweets numbered 1-5 for you to match to the users.
